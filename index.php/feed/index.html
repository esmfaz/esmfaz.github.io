I don&#8217;t want to say &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; because, as a marketing major turned wannabe-technologist, that has always struck me as evidence of nothing more important to say. But then, the theme I&#8217;m using already did that once and then, apparently, I did it again while talking about how unimportant the act is. I leave you with this thought. Saying hello to the world is now much more important to me than I ever thought it could be.</p>
