				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again, world. I&#8217;ve updated my employment status to &#8220;gainfully employed&#8221; and now I&#8217;m working with new software I couldn&#8217;t afford on my own as well as updating this WordPress working directory, which I obviously can afford. Things have been worse and I&#8217;m trying my hardest to improve every day. It&#8217;s the best plan I&#8217;ve seen out there so I&#8217;ll stick with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve updated the [footer.php] template to reflect how I&#8217;m posting this site as cheaply as possible, basically only paying for a domain name. The rest is handled by the Static Site Plugin for WordPress, and GitHub pages. I hereby offer my humble appreciation for that internet toolkit that came to me assembled and ready to plug and play.</p>
<p>The new gig details will stay under wraps for now but in time, I hope to elaborate on that as well. Let&#8217;s say after I get past the one year mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the very first thing I have to say on my outrageously-easy-to-deploy WordPress blog: the time has come for me to open up my insides to the world. I don&#8217;t want to say &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; because, as a marketing major turned wannabe-technologist, that has always struck me as evidence of nothing more important to say. But then, the theme I&#8217;m using already did that once and then, apparently, I did it again while talking about how unimportant the act is. I leave you with this thought. Saying hello to the world is now much more important to me than I ever thought it could be.</p>
